Background:
-----------
Built for Django Dash 2009. Not the most complicated app. I didn't have that much time to work on this and wanted something I knew I could finish in a handful of hours.

Description:
------------
Simple user created contact forms for one-way messaging.

Example use: If your using Twitter and you would like your followers to send you a message without using an @reply, following them to use direct message or giving out you email address. Simply put the url this creates in your update. 

Example URL:
------------
http://tnycnt.com/ 

Third Party Code Used for site:
------------
django-registration http://bitbucket.org/ubernostrum/django-registration/wiki/Home
django-pagination http://github.com/ericflo/django-pagination/tree/master
python recaptcha-client http://pypi.python.org/pypi/recaptcha-client

Install:
------------
Settings file will need some additions:
RECAPTCHA_PUB_KEY 
RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY 
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL
TNYCNT_MAIL_SUBJECT

Having these might be a good idea:
EMAIL_DEBUG 
EMAIL_HOST
EMAIL_HOST_USER
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD 
CONTACT_EMAIL

Possible future enhancements:
------------
 - Custom form fields
 - Message inbox
